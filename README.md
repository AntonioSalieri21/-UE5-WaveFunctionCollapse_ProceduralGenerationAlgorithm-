Unreal Engine project which implements Wave Function Collapse algorithm to proceduraly generate environment. Also uses backtracking for error solving.
Also implements on-fly chunk generation (like Minecraft)

Implemented in Blueprints, in the future C++ implementation would be added as branch.

For explanation how algorithm works check original author: https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse

Tasks:
- [X] Base structure
- [X] Tile blueprint
- [X] Chunk generation
- [X] On-fly generation
- [ ] Move code to C++
